Optional.  Default: `\"*:*\"`\n    :type q: string\n    :param fq: any filter queries to apply.  Note: `+site_id:{ckan_site_id}`\n        is added to this string prior to the query being executed.\n    :type fq: string\n    :param sort: sorting of the search results.  Optional.  Default:\n        'relevance asc, metadata_modified desc'.  As per the solr\n        documentation, this is a comma-separated string of field names and\n        sort-orderings.\n    :type sort: string\n    :param rows: the number of matching rows to return.\n    :type rows: int\n    :param start: the offset in the complete result for where the set of\n        returned datasets should begin.\n    :type start: int\n    :param facet: whether to enable faceted results.  Default: \"true\".\n    :type facet: string\n    :param facet.mincount: the minimum counts for facet fields should be\n        included in the results.\n    :type facet.mincount: int\n    :param facet.limit: the maximum number of values the facet fields return.\n        A negative value means unlimited. This can be set instance-wide with\n        the :ref:`search.facets.limit` config option. Default is 50.\n    :type facet.limit: int\n    :param facet.field: the fields to facet upon.  Default empty.  If empty,\n        then the returned facet information is empty.\n    :type facet.field: list of strings\n\n\n    The following advanced Solr parameters are supported as well. Note that\n    some of these are only available on particular Solr versions. See Solr's\n    `dismax`_ and `edismax`_ documentation for further details on them:\n\n    ``qf``, ``wt``, ``bf``, ``boost``, ``tie``, ``defType``, ``mm``\n\n\n    .. _dismax: http://wiki.apache.org/solr/DisMaxQParserPlugin\n    .. _edismax: http://wiki.apache.org/solr/ExtendedDisMax\n\n\n    **Results:**\n\n    The result of this action is a dict with the following keys:\n\n    :rtype: A dictionary with the following keys\n    :param count: the number of results found.  Note, this is the total number\n        of results found, not the total number of results returned (which is\n        affected by limit and row parameters used in the input).\n    :type count: int\n    :param results: ordered list of datasets matching the query, where the\n        ordering defined by the sort parameter used in the query.\n    :type results: list of dictized datasets.\n    :param facets: DEPRECATED.  Aggregated information about facet counts.\n    :type facets: DEPRECATED dict\n    :param search_facets: aggregated information about facet counts.  The outer\n        dict is keyed by the facet field name (as used in the search query).\n        Each entry of the outer dict is itself a dict, with a \"title\" key, and\n        an \"items\" key.  The \"items\" key's value is a list of dicts, each with\n        \"count\", \"display_name\" and \"name\" entries.  The display_name is a\n        form of the name that can be used in titles.\n    :type search_facets: nested dict of dicts.\n    :param use_default_schema: use default package schema instead of\n        a custom schema defined with an IDatasetForm plugin (default: False)\n    :type use_default_schema: bool\n\n    An example result: ::\n\n     {'count': 2,\n      'results': [ { <snip> }, { <snip> }],\n      'search_facets': {u'tags': {'items': [{'count': 1,\n                                             'display_name': u'tolstoy',\n                                             'name': u'tolstoy'},\n                                            {'count': 2,\n                                             'display_name': u'russian',\n                                             'name': u'russian'}\n                                           ]\n                                 }\n                       }\n     }\n\n    **Limitations:**\n\n    The full solr query language is not exposed, including.\n\n    fl\n        The parameter that controls which fields are returned in the solr\n        query cannot be changed.
