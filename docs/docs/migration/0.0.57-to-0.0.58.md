-   Deploy a shell pod to access the persistent volume:

```
kubectl -n <your namespace> apply -f https://gist.githubusercontent.com/t83714/b52f699c394f4a2150212f24fd7aa4fa/raw/b7d5784b1ef6d39ce542b3b998f136d9d08e3fd9/shell-pod.yaml
```

-   Gain the shell access to the shell pod: `kubectl -n <your namespace> exec -it shell-pod -- /bin/bash`
-   `cd /export` and run the following cmds on all dirs list by `ls -la`
-   `chown -R 1000 <data-dir> && chmod u+rxw <data-dir>`
-   Delete the shell pod
