# Migrate from Magda v0.0.60 to v1.0.0

## Upgrade database

Magda v1.0.0 has upgrade postgreSQL to version 13. If you use dataset service from cloud providers (e.g. AWS RDS or Google Cloud SQL), you can use tools from the service providers to upgrade your database before upgrade Magda.

If you use in-k8s postgreSQL dataset instance that comes with Magda, you can upgrade the database instance by:

- Turn on [backup mode](#turn-on-backup-mode-prior-to-v100) of your in-k8s postgreSQL dataset instance and complete at least one base backup
- Test your base backup by recover a test Magda site with [recovery mode](#turn-on-recovery-mode-prior-to-v100)
- Upgrade to Magda v1.0.0 with Recovery Mode turned on to recover from the backup made earlier
  - See [this document](../how-to-recover-with-continuous-archive-backup.md) for information of backup & recovery on version v1.0.0 or later

> Please note, you might want to test the steps on a seperate test site before proceed to a production site upgrade.

### Turn on Backup Mode (Prior to v1.0.0)

> For information of turning on backup mode on Magda v1.0.0 or later, please refer to [this document](../how-to-recover-with-continuous-archive-backup.md).

To turn on Backup Mode (Prior to Magda v1.0.0) and use Google GCS as storage, you need to set `waleBackup` config option of `combined-db` helm chart. Here is an example:

```yaml
combined-db:
  waleBackup:
    method: WAL
    gsPrefix: "gs://xx-xxx-xx/xx"
    executionTime: 03:00
    googleApplicationCreds:
      secretName: backup-storage-account-credentials
      fileName: my-gcs-key.json
```

Before the deployment, you need to manually create a secret (named `backup-storage-account-credentials` as specified in config above) and set key `my-gcs-key.json` to the content of your GCS JSON key file.

> Please note, if you want to use AWS S3 as storage, you can set key `waleBackup.s3Prefix`, `waleBackup.awsAccessKeyId`, `waleBackup.secretAccessKey` and `waleBackup.awsRegion` instead.

### Turn on Recovery Mode (Prior to v1.0.0)

> For information of turning on recovery mode on Magda v1.0.0 or later, please refer to [this document](../how-to-recover-with-continuous-archive-backup.md).

To turn on Recovery Mode (Prior to Magda v1.0.0) and use Google GCS as storage, you need to set `waleBackup` config option of `combined-db` helm chart. Here is an example:

```yaml
combined-db:
  waleBackup:
    method: WAL
    readOnly: "TRUE"
    recoveryMode: "immediate"
    gsPrefix: "gs://xx-xxx-xx/xx"
    googleApplicationCreds:
      secretName: backup-storage-account-credentials
      fileName: my-gcs-key.json
```

Before the deployment, you need to manually create a secret (named `backup-storage-account-credentials` as specified in config above) and set key `my-gcs-key.json` to the content of your GCS JSON key file.

> Please note, if you want to use AWS S3 as storage, you can set key `waleBackup.s3Prefix`, `waleBackup.awsAccessKeyId`, `waleBackup.secretAccessKey` and `waleBackup.awsRegion` instead.

## Incompatible Changes

### Removal of `noDbAuth` mode

Previously, you can set `global.noDbAuth` to `true` to allow logging into in-k8s postgreSQL instance with no password. This option has been removed since v1.0.0, you are required to remove `global.noDbAuth` option from your config to avoid problems.
