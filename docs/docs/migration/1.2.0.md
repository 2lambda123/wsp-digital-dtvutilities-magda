# Migrate from Magda v1.0.0 / v1.1.0 to v1.2.0

## Elasticsearch Upgrade

In v1.2.0, we upgraded elasticsearch to 6.8.22 (from 6.5.4). Once you upgrade Magda to v1.2.0, indexer will auto-recreate all elasticsearch indexes for newer version elasticsearch engine. Depends on your database size, this might take some time.

To avoid showing incomplete result till re-index is completed, you can manually set the index version that search API uses to the existing versions via [helm chart options](https://github.com/magda-io/magda/blob/944ae887842b98c51698d567435003be2e9dbefd/deploy/helm/internal-charts/search-api/values.yaml#L29).

e.g. you can set the following in your helm deployment values file / config:

```yaml
search-api:
  datasetsIndexVersion: 48
  regionsIndexVersion: 25
  publishersIndexVersion: 6
  formatsIndexVersion: 2
```
